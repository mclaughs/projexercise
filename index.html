  <h3>Centered H3 Header</h3>
  <h4>Centered headings are classy...</h4>
    <p class="mid">...especially when they are followed by shorter paragraphs.</p>
  <h5 id="warm">Why would you ever assign an id to a specific element if it can only
      be used once?</h5>
    <p>This is the paragraph...</p>
    <p class="redletter">...and this is the paragraph colored red.</p>
    <p class="typewriter">This paragraph is also coded with typewriter class.</p>
    <p class="important">This is the paragraph coded with the important class.</p>
    <p>The paragraph with <em>hardcoded</em> style tags where <i>classes</i>
        are <strong>not</strong> used.</p>
    <p>In this one, though, <span class="emphasized">I am styling with a

    <p class="justify">Four-score and seven years ago our Fathers brought forth upon this continent
       a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that
       all men are created equal.  Now we are engaged in a great Civil War and that's

    <p>By default, a blockquote is set in.  You can also optionally style it such
      as by using the color grey as shown.  But avoid fancy fonts please.</p>
  </blockquote>
    <p class="offset">When you're specifying all four margins in one statement, you specify them
      in clockwise order, starting at the top.  Let's say you want a right margin
      twice the size of default text, a left margin 1.75 the size of the font and
      no margins on the top or bottom.  You'd write...</P>
    <p class="offset">If you want to add space between paragraphs, instead of or in addition to
      a first-line indent, specify a bottom margin.  This code adds space between
      paragraphs...Instead of all four margins you can specify individual margins.
      An alternative to the above example...Add a class of paragraphs to your CSS
      file that has extra whitespace all around it.</p>
